  I designed this site using
  <a href="https://www.figma.com">Figma</a>.
  The background colors are
  <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Crayola_crayon_colors">
    approximations of Crayola crayon colors</a>,
  and I checked all color combinations using the
  <a href="https://www.whocanuse.com" aria-label="Who Can Use">WhoCanUse</a>
  color contrast tool to make sure they are accessible to people experiencing
  a wide range of permanent, temporary, and situational visual disabilities.

  I built this site with
  <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>
  to take advantage of its component-friendly templating engine.
  All the CSS is custom, and I kept the JavaScript to a minimum.
